### Step :1 Installing Suricata in Ubuntu 18.04

Rather than installing from source, we will use Personal Package Archives (PPA) for updating and installation. This process can be simplified by using the Suricata Ubuntu packages.
To setup to install the latest stable Suricata, do:
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
```
