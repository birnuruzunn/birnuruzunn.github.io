### Introduction to Suricata

[<img src="https://openisf.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/suricata_logo.jpg" width="250" height="200" style="float:right; padding:23px" />](https://openisf.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/suricata_logo.jpg) Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine [[1](https://suricata-ids.org/)]. It analyzes all traffic in the firewall and searches for known attacks and anomalies. It was developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). The source code of the product can be accessed via the following Github address;

### Step :1 Installing Suricata in Ubuntu 18.04

Rather than installing from source, we will use Personal Package Archives (PPA) for updating and installation the latest stable Suricata. This process can be simplified by using the Suricata Ubuntu packages [[2](https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/wiki/Ubuntu_Installation_-_Personal_Package_Archives_(PPA))].
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
```
Then you can install the latest stable Suricata with:
```
sudo apt-get install suricata 
```
or for the Suricata package with build in (enabled) debugging!
```
sudo apt-get install suricata-dbg
```

### Getting Started - Initial Configuration

At the end of the installation, we can see the Suricata rules under this path: **/etc/suricata/rules/** .
In the next step, we will try to get the rules with **Emerging Threats** that is a repository for Snort and Suricata rules [[3](https://hackertarget.com/install-suricata-ubuntu-5-minutes/)].
```
wget http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata/emerging.rules.tar.gz
tar zxvf emerging.rules.tar.gz
sudo mkdir /var/lib/suricata/
sudo mv rules /var/lib/suricata/
```
We also need to check the **/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml** file for additional configuration. Make sure every variable of the vars, address-groups and port-groups in the yaml file is set correctly for your needs.  You need to set the ip-address(es) of your local network at **HOME_NET**. It is recommended to set **EXTERNAL_NET** to **!$HOME_NET**. This way, every ip-address but the one set at **HOME_NET*** will be treated as external [[4](https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/wiki/Basic_Setup)].
```
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```
Change the following lines:
```
HOME_NET: "your machine's ip address, for example mine is 192.168.56.0/24" 
EXTERNAL_NET: "!$HOME_NET"
```
