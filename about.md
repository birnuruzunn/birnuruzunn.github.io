### Hi, I'm Birnur! :wave: :blush:

I am a **Computer Engineer** who loves to learn new things, is determined, hardworking and is very keen on technology. 
I am also a **master's student in Information Systems Engineering**. :mortar_board: :books: :smile:

Whenever I have the opportunity, I develop open-source projects and share them here. 
It is my greatest wish and happiness that my works can be a solution to people's problems.

I am currently working on computer networks security and system management.
